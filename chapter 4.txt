Chapter 4 - Styling your Website and Game

Now that we've got our game working, it's time to make it look better. To do this we're going to revisit our styles.css sheet, which tells our browser how each element of our HTML page should be displayed.

Some of the quickest ways you can personalise your website is by changing how the writing looks, so let's update the font style and add some color. 

 
You might have noticed that in the styles page we gave you there's a section of code that looks like this:
	
	html {
		font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
	}
	
This piece of code tells the html page which fonts to use. Let's try changing the font-family to something different by typing in the name of a font you want to use.  If you want to use a specific font like Comic sans, you just put the name of the font in twice.
We can also add the 'font-weight' property which says how thick the individual text is typed on the webpage, or the 'font-size' property which determines how large the text will be on the page.   Your code should now look something like this:


	html {
		font-family: "Comic Sans", "Comic Sans", cursive;
		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: large;
	}

Don't forget to refresh your webpage every time you make a change so you can see what it looks like!



 Looking a little better, but this page could really use some colour. 
 
 To make our text something other than a basic black, we need to add the 'color' property in the html section.  Warning!  VS Code uses the american spelling of 'color' so be sure to double check that.
 
 There are four ways to specify what colour you want:
	Name 	color: red
	RGB 	color: rgb(255,0,0);
	HSL  	color: hsl(0,100%, 50%);
	HEX  	color: #ff0000;
 
 A list of colours can be found at: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp
 
	 html {
		font-family: "Comic Sans", "Comic Sans", cursive;
		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: large;
		color: blue;
	}
 
 
 That clicker button in the middle could also use some colour!  Only this time we need to change the 'background-color' of the button. 
 
Your code should look like this:
	.clicker {
		font-size: 128px;
		display: block;
		margin: auto;
		background-color: rgb(255, 99, 71);
	}
